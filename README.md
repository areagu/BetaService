TargetFramework = net5.0
VisualStudioVersion = 16.0.810.17
OS = MacOS Monterey Verion 12.1

To build & run:
from within Visual Studio, hit F5 a default browser will take you to a swagger page
with BetaService input parameters that you can provide.

Notes:
I have not touched Java in years, so chose C# as my language of choice
service returns betas for the several use cases listed in the assignment
more test cases would need to be written
there is opportunity for performance enhancements (async and parallelization)
